### [Level 1: Grassroots](https://psyteachr.github.io/ug1-practical/)

Our first-year undergraduate course covers current state of psychological science and what Open Science is as well as its importance. It also aims to make students confident and competent at using RStudio as a tool to achieve good data management skills.

### [Level 2: Practical](https://philmcaleer.github.io/ug2-practical/)

Our second-year undergraduate course covers data skills such as R Markdown, data wrangling with tidyverse, and data visualisation with ggplot2. It also introduces statistical concepts such as permutation tests, NHST, alpha, power, effect size, and sample size. Semester 2 focusses on correlations and the general linear model.
